# Waterfall Development Methodology

Waterfall is the core workflow used in each of the three development processes.

<b>Waterfall Phases:</b>
1. Requirements Gathering - Understand the requirements of your project.
2. Design - Design solution to meet the requirements.
3. Implementation - Engineering and implementation.
4. Testing - Make sure it all works.
5. Release to Market - Customer, Stakeholder, and Consumer get the product.

<b>Key advantages:</b>
1. Having a static set of requirements reduces time and resource risk.

<b>Key disadvantages:</b>
1. Unable to make dynamic changes in requirements
2. No feedback from the customers
3. No feedback from the consumers
4. Higher risk of customer and market dissatisfaction

# Agile Development Methodology

Agile development is an iterative approach to a compressed waterfall development process called <b>sprints</b>.  Take a look at the new waterfall process we use below.
This time we gear the initial design towards a <b>minimal viable product</b>.

<b>Compressed Waterfall Phases:</b>
1. Requirements Gathering - Understand the requirements of your project.
2. <b>Design - We design for minimal viable product and in subsequent iterations we design additional requirements.</b>
3. Implementation - Engineering and implementation.
4. Testing - Make sure it all works.
5. Build and Release + Maintenance - Release the code.

<b>Agile Phases:</b>
1. Sprint:(Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback
2. Sprint:(Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback
3. Sprint:(Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback
4. Sprint:(Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback
5. Release to Market - Customer, Stakeholder, and Consumer get the product.

<b>Key advantages:</b>
1. Receive customer feedback each sprint.
2. Ability to adapt requirements to add value.

<b>Key disadvantages:</b>
1. Project dependent on feedback cycles. More pressure on individual sprints.
2. Potential risk to time lines and resources
3. No feedback from the consumers

# Lean Development Methodology

Lean development is the same iterative approach as Agile with one major exception.  We release our code to market with every compressed waterfall iteration.
<br>

<b>Lean Phases:</b>
1. Sprint:(Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback + Get Market Feedback
2. Sprint:(Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback + Get Market Feedback
3. Sprint:(Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback + Get Market Feedback
4. Sprint:(Compressed Waterfall Phases) + Get Customer Feedback + Get Market Feedback
5. Final Release to Market - Customer, Stakeholder, and Consumer get the product

<b>Key advantages:</b>
1. Receive market feedback each sprint
2. Allows us to identify and eliminate waste from the product and process
3. Ability to adapt requirements to add value

<b>Key disadvantages:</b>
1. Project dependent on feedback cycles. More pressure on individual sprints
2. Potentially risk to time lines and resources

<b>Potential Satisfaction Risk</b> - Risk of not satisfying customer and market needs.

<b>Potential Timeline Risk</b> - Add resource risk with the addition of dynamic changes to our processes

<b>Potential Resource Risk</b> - Add resource risk with the addition of dynamic changes to our processes

<b>Potential Value Add</b> - Solicit customer feedback and adapt requirements

<b>Potential Waste Elimination</b> - Ability to solicit market feedback and eliminate waste
